# Peter Walter Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository.  
This repo showcases my work, skills, and projects as I grow as a Web Developer, Database focused problem solver, and technical builder.

I’m currently a student, but I approach projects with a real world mindset focusing on clarity, structure, performance, and usability.

## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Peter Walter 👋  
I’m passionate about building clean, functional web experiences and working with databases and backend systems.

I enjoy:
- Turning ideas into working products
- Writing clean, readable code
- Learning how real systems scale and work in production
- Solving problems with technology instead of overcomplicating them

This portfolio is a living space I update it as I learn, build, and improve.
